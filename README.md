# Krebostone Backend

This repo contains the code for the backend of the manager system. Please visit the other repo for frontend.

Krebostone is a manage platform for private minecraft servers. Each single instance of Krebostone Manager could manage one of your Minecraft Java Servers. Also you could have multiple instances for different servers.

Krebostone meant to be "paralelle management", which is means that everyone has the access to the server could have the access to the simple portal as well, and Krebostone will also provide simple and beautiful user interface.

Krebostone contains the following features (also will contain in the future):
- Basic user and whitelist management. (You have to turn on whitelist because Krebostone based on that)
- Basic server management (Opening / Closing / Issuing command / etc.)
- Backup saves and servers and provide portal to download (Still working on)
- Quick mods references and download (Still working on...)
- And some other tiny tools (Todo / Blog / Notifications / etc.) (Still working on...)

If you have any question or met any issues, please either open an issue, or directly contact the developer of Krebostone!

The whole project is running and powered by LOVE!
